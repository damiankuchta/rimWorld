I was planning to a board game, but i ceased the project, I went through the idea I had, and It either would be too complicated for a board game, 
or wouldn't have enought variety in the game to be fun.

This is a prototype I was planning to use to set up the rules and game variables, not much, but I think I made a good job keeping the code DRY (a day of work in here)
